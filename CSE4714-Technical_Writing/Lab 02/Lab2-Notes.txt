Research -> systematic investigation
Features of a quality research:
Clear Research Goal/Research Ques/Research Problem
Method
Data
Reproducability
Contribute to knowledge domain + Clear (Peer Reviewed)
Ethical

Not quality research (the above features absent):
Publish take time
Funding

Steps:
1. Clear Research Goal
2. Literature Review (Other papers and their drawbacks)
3. Perfect Research Methodology
	- Design (Fix parameters)
	- Data (what type of data using)
	- Metric (based on what evaluate your work)
4. Experiment : limitations, parameter values...
5. Analysis : analyze result, verdict if supporting Research goal, which cases it's working and which cases it's not working
6. Presentation : slide, Technical report, journal (Get credibility)

Types of Research:
1. Basic - only increase knowledge, no application
2. Applied - real life prob, soln applied
3. Primary - new knowledge inherited
4. Secondary - based on existing knowledge improve idea
5. Quantitative - working with numerical data, formula
6. Qualitative - hypothesis, philosophy
7. Survery- questionnaire, get/collect operational data from sample people
8. Experimental - performed in a controlled environment (fixed variables)
9. Case Study - investigation on single person/organization


PRACTICAL


mathematical eqn
1. inline math (inside para)
2. display math (in a separate line by itself)

What is research?
A systematic investigation approach

Benefits:
Learn, solve, literature review, make appropriate division

Types:
Quantitative, Qualitative

Or
Basic, Applied, Experimental

Basic: only contributes in improving knowledge
Applied: Done based on data
Survey: Collect Data only
Experimental: Happens in a controlled environment where the values of some variables are known which when changed affects directly to the outcome of the research
Case Study: 

Features of Research
i) Clear Goal (Have an appropriate research question
ii) Appropriate Method
iii) Data (If data is biased / unifitting)
iv) Ethics (Acknowledgement or giving credit of work that you have used from other researchers)
v) Clear outcome
vi) Peer reviews
